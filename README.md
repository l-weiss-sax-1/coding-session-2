## Hi!

Hi all,
As requested I've put up this repository for you guys to see the code we have created together last couple sessions.
If you want to get this code, here are the steps: 

1. if you haven't already, download 'git' with the add/remove software
2. you can press the green 'code' button on top of this page, to get the https or ssl clone link
3. go to your terminal and go to the location you want this code to live, i.e. '```mkdir projects && cd projects```'
4. now do ```git clone <here the copied link>```
5. code should now be downloaded and you should be able to see it if you open the folder with vscode!

If you have issues cloning or authenticating with github, see the how to clone with ssh in these guides:
https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh 

no worries if you have issues with this. Git will be handled way later in the program, and if you are still curious you can always ask me to explain this at the end of a workday at school!
